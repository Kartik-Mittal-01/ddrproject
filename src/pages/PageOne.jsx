      <Section title="History of Plastic">
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            The journey of plastic began in 1862, when Alexander Parkes introduced a material called Parkesine at an international exhibition in London. This was a semi-synthetic plastic derived from cellulose nitrate, which could be heated, molded, and retained its shape upon cooling. It marked the beginning of a new era in material science. 
        </p>
        <ImageSection src= 'hardikimages/IMAGE2.png' />
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Later, in 1907, Leo Baekeland developed the first fully synthetic plastic known as Bakelite. This material was revolutionary due to its properties such as heat resistance, electrical insulation, and durability, making it ideal for industrial and household applications.
        </p>
        <ImageSection src= 'hardikimages/IMAGE 3.png' />
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Over time, plastics evolved into the wide variety of materials we use today, becoming essential in almost every industry. However, with this growth came challenges, especially in managing plastic waste effectively.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="How Plastic is Made">
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastic production is based on a process called polymerization, where small molecules known as monomers combine under heat, pressure, and catalysts to form long chains called polymers. For example, ethylene molecules are transformed into polyethylene, one of the most common plastics used worldwide. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            However, polymers alone are not enough. To achieve the desired properties, manufacturers add various substances known as additives. These additives enhance strength, flexibility, color, durability, and resistance to heat or fire. The final product is a carefully engineered material tailored for specific uses.
        </p>
        <ImageSection src= 'hardikimages/image 4.png' />

      <Section title="Classification of Plastics">
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            In this section, we deepen our understanding of plastics by exploring their classification based on behavior, structure, properties, and resin types. This knowledge is essential because different plastics behave differently during recycling, reuse, and disposal, making classification a key step in effective plastic waste management. 
        </p>
        <h5>
            Plastic Resin Codes (1–7)
        </h5>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastics are also identified using resin identification codes, which indicate their type and recyclability:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is commonly used for beverage bottles due to its strength, clarity, and moisture resistance. It is one of the most recyclable plastics. </li>
            <li>HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) is strong, durable, and resistant to heat, making it ideal for containers like milk bottles, detergent bottles, and drums. </li>
            <li>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) is widely used in pipes, cables, and construction materials but is difficult to recycle and can release harmful substances if not managed properly. </li>
            <li>LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) is used in plastic bags and packaging films and forms a large portion of household plastic waste. </li>
            <li>Polypropylene (PP) is used in food containers, medical equipment, and household items due to its strength and chemical resistance. </li>
            <li>Polystyrene (PS) is used in disposable cups, plates, and packaging foam but poses serious environmental concerns due to poor recyclability. </li>
            <li>Others: Includes polycarbonate, nylon, and mixed plastics</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Generally, plastics with lower numbers (like PET and HDPE) are easier to recycle, while higher numbers are more complex and less economically viable to process. 
        </p>
        <h5>
            Thermoplastics vs Thermosetting Plastics
        </h5>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastics can be broadly divided based on how they respond to heat:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thermoplastics soften when heated and harden upon cooling. This process can be repeated multiple times, making them highly recyclable and suitable for reshaping into new products. These plastics are widely used because of their flexibility, ease of processing, and recyclability. </li>
            <li>On the other hand, thermosetting plastics undergo an irreversible chemical change when heated. Once molded, they cannot be reshaped or remelted. While they are more resistant to heat and suitable for engineering applications, they are difficult to recycle and often used in waste-to-energy processes instead.</li>
            <li>Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, while thermosetting plastics include epoxy, polyurethane, and phenolic materials. </li>
        </ul>
        


        <h5 style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Plastics
        </h5>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastics can also be classified based on their internal structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homogeneous plastics are made primarily of hydrocarbon chains and have a uniform structure. Examples include polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. </li>
            <li>Heterogeneous plastics contain additional elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine in their structure. These plastics are more complex and include materials like PVC, nylon, and ABS. </li>
            <li>This structural difference affects properties like strength, flexibility, and recyclability.</li>
        </ul>


        <h5 style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Physical Types of Plastics
        </h5>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Based on physical and mechanical properties, plastics can be categorized into four main types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rigid plastics have high strength and retain their shape under stress. Examples include HDPE containers and PET bottles. </li>
            <li>Semi-rigid plastics offer moderate flexibility and can deform under pressure but return to their original shape once the force is removed.  </li>
            <li>Soft plastics are highly flexible and slowly regain their shape after deformation. These are commonly used in toys and packaging. </li>
            <li>Elastomers are extremely elastic materials that can stretch significantly and return to their original form, similar to rubber bands. </li>

            Plastic pollution is not just about waste—it directly impacts ecosystems and human health. When plastics break down into microplastics, they enter the food chain through water, fish, and even everyday items like salt. This makes proper plastic management more critical than ever.

      <Section title="Plastic vs Plastic Waste">
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastic itself is not inherently harmful—it has improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced quality of life across industries. The real issue lies in the mismanagement of plastic waste, especially single-use plastics. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Effective solutions should focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper waste management</li>
            <li>Recycling and segregation</li>
            <li>Reducing single-use plastics</li>
            <li>Developing sustainable alternatives</li>
        </ul>

      <Section title="Why Plastic Pollution is Rising">
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Plastic pollution is increasing due to several factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapid growth in plastic production</li>
            <li>Heavy reliance on single-use plastics</li>
            <li>Lack of proper waste management systems</li>
            <li>Import/export of plastic waste between countries</li>
            <li>Low recycling rates for certain plastic types</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", color: "#444", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            This highlights that the issue is not plastic itself, but how we manage plastic after use.
